# Network Security Design
This course was taken in my final year of study at Madison College. We worked as a team of 5 students on the design, planning and implementation of a secure enterprise network representing the typical services offered by a business such as guest users, contractors and personal devices (BYOD). 

We had hands-on access to the following equipment in our lab environment:
<ul>
  <li>Cisco 1841 Integrated Services Router
  <li>Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series Switch
  <li>Cisco Catalyst 3500 Series Switch
  <li>Cisco ASA 5505 Adaptive Security Appliance
</ul>

We also had access to Software such as: VMWare, ESXi and Server 2012
